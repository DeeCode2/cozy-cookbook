# My Cookbook Diary

My Cookbook Diary is CRUD application I created to organise my recipes.

## Technologies

For the database and authentication, I used Firebase. Create-React-App was used to set up the front-end and React-Router-v6 was used to manage routing.

Current features include:

- User authentication
- CRUD functions
- Routing

## Usage

Currently, users can create an account or login. Then, they can add, view, delete and edit recipes including the title, ingredients and instructions.

## Work In Progress

This project is incomplete, however I plan to implement a search and filter function to give users more controll over their recipes. There is an otpiton to add tags to each recipe and eventually, users will be able to click on the tags to filter them automatically.
